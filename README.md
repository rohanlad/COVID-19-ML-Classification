This project aimed to classify whether a Covid-19 patient would survive or die based on epidemiological data. The dataset included key features such as age, sex, location, confirmed date, travel history, and chronic disease status.

I explored three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbous, and Linear SVM.
